Each of these special arguments allows us to pass a variable number of arguments to a function, which are then automatically packaged and passed to the function as a tuple or dictionary, respectively.\n",

The `*` tells Python to take all the arguments that are passed to the function and put them in a tuple called `args`. This allows us to pass a variable number of arguments to a function. This is effectively very similar to the above example of passing in a list, but this one is seamless to the user - someone using our addition function doesn't need to manually construct a list, they just need to provide what they want added. \n",
    "\n",
    "When using *args, the individual arguments that our function receives aren't labeled, so we can't call them specifically outside of their index in the tuple. This option is normally used where all the arguments captured are the same type, and we want to combine them or do something to all of them, like in these math operations. "

The `**` tells Python to take all the keyword arguments that are passed to the function and put them in a dictionary called `kwargs`. This allows us to pass a variable number of keyword arguments to a function. \n",

    "The dictionary that is passed with the arguments is formatted so that the argument names are the keys and the values are the values. In contrast to the *args option, this gives us arguments by name, so we can call them specifically. One example of where this is used is with generating visualizations, there can be a **kwargs argument passed through that can contain an assortment of optional arguments for things like line thickness, title font, gridlines, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "When using the **kwargs arguments we can deal with those arguments in a couple of different ways. We can look to see if the specific argument we want is set in the dictionary, and if so, take that. We can also loop through them and get the key/value pair if we are dealing with something we want to list out. Our example is looking for specific attributes in the kwargs dictionary - the get() function below will return the value of the key if it exists, if it doesn't will return None, or the provided default value of False. We can use this to easily use the kwargs values if they are provided, or use a default value if they are not."
